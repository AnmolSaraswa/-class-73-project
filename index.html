          <p class="text-muted">A computer lab is a space where computer services are provided to a defined community.
            These are typically public libraries and academic institutions.Generally, users must follow a certain user
            policy to retain access to the computers. This usually consists of rules such as no illegal activity during
            use or attempts to circumvent any security or content-control software while using the computers. Computer
            labs are often subject to time limits, this is to allow more people have a chance to use the lab. It is also
            common for personal login credentials to be required for access.</p>
